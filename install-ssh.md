If your Debian server doesn't have the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file, there are a few possibilities to consider:

Missing OpenSSH package: It's possible that the OpenSSH package isn't installed on your server, as this file is part of the OpenSSH server package. To check if OpenSSH is installed and install it if necessary, you can run:

bash
Copy
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openssh-server
After installation, the sshd_config file should be created in /etc/ssh/.

Alternative file location: It's possible the file might be located somewhere else due to custom configuration or packaging. Try searching for it with:

bash
Copy
sudo find / -name sshd_config
Permissions issue: If the file exists but isn't visible for some reason (perhaps due to file permissions), you can check the permissions of the /etc/ssh directory:

bash
Copy
ls -l /etc/ssh
Create the file manually: If the sshd_config file is indeed missing and OpenSSH is installed, you can create a new one. Here's a basic version of the file:

bash
Copy
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
And you can add the following content for a basic SSH configuration:

plaintext
Copy
# Sample sshd_config file
Port 22
PermitRootLogin no
PasswordAuthentication yes
Save the file and restart SSH:

bash
Copy
sudo systemctl restart sshd
After this, you should be able to configure your SSH server. Let me know if you'd like further details!
