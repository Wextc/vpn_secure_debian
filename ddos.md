Yes! You can use iptables to block traffic after a certain number of requests, effectively stopping your website from serving once the limit is hit. Here’s how you can do it:

1. Block After 2000 Requests Using iptables
You can track incoming requests per IP and block access once they exceed 2000.


```,
iptables -N RATE_LIMIT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -m state --state NEW -j RATE_LIMIT
iptables -A RATE_LIMIT -m recent --set --name web_limit
iptables -A RATE_LIMIT -m recent --update --seconds 86400 --hitcount 2000 --name web_limit -j DROP

```
Explanation:

```
-N RATE_LIMIT → Creates a new chain for rate limiting.
-A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 → Applies to new incoming requests on port 80 (HTTP).
-m recent --set --name web_limit → Tracks incoming requests.
--update --seconds 86400 --hitcount 2000 → If an IP makes 2000 requests in 24 hours, it gets blocked.
-j DROP → Completely blocks further requests.

```

2. Block All Traffic to the Server After 2000 Requests
If you want to shut down all access (not per IP), you can use a global counter.

```
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -m limit --limit 2000/day -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j DROP

```
How It Works:
--limit 2000/day → Allows 2000 requests in 24 hours.
After 2000 requests, all traffic is dropped, effectively taking the site offline.
3. Reset Counter Daily (Optional)
Since iptables counters persist, you may want to reset them daily:

```
echo "0" > /proc/net/xt_recent/web_limit

```
or use cron:

```
echo "0 0 * * * iptables -F" | crontab -

```
This resets the rules at midnight.

Which Method is Best?
✅ Method 1 (Per IP Block) → If you want to block abusive users but allow normal traffic.
✅ Method 2 (Global Limit) → If you want to shut down the website completely after 2000 requests.
