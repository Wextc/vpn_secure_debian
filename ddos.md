Even if you are using UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall), you can still modify iptables manually because UFW is just a frontend for iptables. However, you need to be careful because direct iptables rules might be overwritten by UFW.

âœ… Best Practice: Use UFWâ€™s Rate Limiting Instead
If you are already using UFW, itâ€™s better to configure the rate limiting within UFW instead of manually adding iptables rules.

1. Use UFW to Limit Connections Per IP
You can limit the number of connections per IP with UFW:


```
sudo ufw limit proto tcp from any to any port 80

```
This limits repeated connections from a single IP.
It doesnâ€™t completely stop the website after 2000 requestsâ€”but it slows down abusive traffic.
2. Use UFW to Deny All Traffic After a Threshold
If you want to completely stop serving the website after 2000 requests, you can block all traffic after the limit is reached using UFW and iptables together:

```
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
sudo iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -m limit --limit 2000/day -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j DROP
```
Allows 2000 requests per day.
Drops all traffic after that, effectively shutting down the website.
3. Reset Rules Daily (Optional)
Since iptables rules persist, you may want to reset them daily using a cron job:

```
sudo crontab -e

```
Add this line:

```
0 0 * * * iptables -F

```
This resets iptables rules at midnight, restarting the count.
Will UFW and iptables Conflict?
âœ… No, but UFW rules are applied first.
âœ… iptables rules still work, but UFW might overwrite them on reboot.

To ensure iptables rules persist, you can save them:

```
sudo iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4

```
Then restore them on reboot:

```
sudo iptables-restore < /etc/iptables/rules.v4

```
Final Thoughts
If you only want to limit per IP â†’ Use ufw limit.
If you want to completely stop serving the website after 2000 requests â†’ Use iptables with UFW.
If you need advanced filtering, consider Cloudflare or Fail2Ban.

 Test with 5 request limit first.
âœ… Verify it works by making 5 requests and checking if the site stops responding.
âœ… Reset the rules and apply the 2000 request limit.
âœ… Save rules so they persist after reboot.
âœ… (Optional) Use a cron job to reset the count daily.


If you want to test with just 5 blocked requests first, then later switch back to the 2000 request limit, follow these steps:

ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Set Up a 5 Request Limit for Testing
Run these commands to temporarily block traffic after 5 requests:

```
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
sudo iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -m limit --limit 5/day -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j DROP

```

âœ… This allows 5 requests per day and then blocks all traffic.

ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Test if Requests Are Blocked
After making 5 requests, your server should stop responding.
To check if the rule is working, use:

```
sudo iptables -vnL INPUT

```
You should see something like:

```
pkts bytes target   prot opt in  out source    destination
5    xxx   ACCEPT   tcp  --  any any anywhere  anywhere tcp dpt:http limit: 5/day
0    0     DROP     tcp  --  any any anywhere  anywhere tcp dpt:http

```

This confirms that 5 requests were accepted, and new ones are blocked.

ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Reset to 2000 Requests After Testing
Once you verify the 5-request test, reset the rule and apply the 2000 request limit:

```
sudo iptables -F  # Clear old rules
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
sudo iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -m limit --limit 2000/day -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j DROP

```

âœ… This restores the 2000 request daily limit.

ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Make Sure Rules Persist on Reboot
Since iptables rules reset when the server reboots, save them:

```
sudo iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4

```
Then, restore them on reboot:

```
sudo iptables-restore < /etc/iptables/rules.v4

```
ðŸ”¹ Step 5: Reset the Rules Automatically at Midnight (Optional)
If you want the request counter to reset daily, set up a cron job:

```
sudo crontab -e

```
Add this line:

```
0 0 * * * iptables -F && iptables-restore < /etc/iptables/rules.v4

```
âœ… This resets the request count every night at midnight.


XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

Removes the 2000 request limit âœ…
Keeps ports 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS), and 5555 open âœ…
Ensures all other traffic is handled normally âœ…
Persists changes after reboot âœ…


Got it! You want to reset the blocked request limit but still keep ports 5555, 443, and 80 open.

Run These Commands to Reset Blocked Requests & Keep Ports Open
ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Reset iptables Rules for Requests

```
sudo iptables -F INPUT  # Clear all input rules
sudo iptables -F OUTPUT # Clear all output rules
sudo iptables -F        # Clear all rules

```

âœ… This removes the request blocking but keeps the firewall active.

ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Allow Ports 5555, 443, and 80

```
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT   # Allow HTTP (Port 80)
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT  # Allow HTTPS (Port 443)
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 5555 -j ACCEPT # Allow Custom Port 5555

```
âœ… Now these ports are open for traffic.

ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Set Default Policies to Allow Normal Traffic

```
sudo iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT   # Accept all incoming traffic (except blocked ones)
sudo iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT # Allow forwarding traffic
sudo iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT  # Allow outgoing traffic

```
âœ… This makes sure your server doesnâ€™t block normal traffic.

ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Save Rules So They Persist on Reboot

```
sudo iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4

```
âœ… Now, the changes will remain even after restarting the server.









































#### If you are not using the ufw, you can manually change the ip table


Yes! You can use iptables to block traffic after a certain number of requests, effectively stopping your website from serving once the limit is hit. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

1. Block After 2000 Requests Using iptables
You can track incoming requests per IP and block access once they exceed 2000.


```,
iptables -N RATE_LIMIT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -m state --state NEW -j RATE_LIMIT
iptables -A RATE_LIMIT -m recent --set --name web_limit
iptables -A RATE_LIMIT -m recent --update --seconds 86400 --hitcount 2000 --name web_limit -j DROP

```
Explanation:

```
-N RATE_LIMIT â†’ Creates a new chain for rate limiting.
-A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 â†’ Applies to new incoming requests on port 80 (HTTP).
-m recent --set --name web_limit â†’ Tracks incoming requests.
--update --seconds 86400 --hitcount 2000 â†’ If an IP makes 2000 requests in 24 hours, it gets blocked.
-j DROP â†’ Completely blocks further requests.

```

2. Block All Traffic to the Server After 2000 Requests
If you want to shut down all access (not per IP), you can use a global counter.

```
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -m limit --limit 2000/day -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j DROP

```
How It Works:
--limit 2000/day â†’ Allows 2000 requests in 24 hours.
After 2000 requests, all traffic is dropped, effectively taking the site offline.
3. Reset Counter Daily (Optional)
Since iptables counters persist, you may want to reset them daily:

```
echo "0" > /proc/net/xt_recent/web_limit

```
or use cron:

```
echo "0 0 * * * iptables -F" | crontab -

```
This resets the rules at midnight.

Which Method is Best?
âœ… Method 1 (Per IP Block) â†’ If you want to block abusive users but allow normal traffic.
âœ… Method 2 (Global Limit) â†’ If you want to shut down the website completely after 2000 requests.
